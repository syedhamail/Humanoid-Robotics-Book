title: Update Project Constitution with detailed guidelines
stage: constitution
date: 2025-12-05
surface: agent
model: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
feature: none
branch: master
user: unknown
command: /sp.constitution Project: AI/Spec-Driven Technical Book on Modern Software Engineering
Platform: Docusaurus + GitHub Pages
    Tools: Spec-Kit Plus, Claude Code, GitHub, Markdown, MDX

Core Principles

AI-Augmented Precision

All content generated with the assistance of LLMs must be checked, validated, and refined through SpecKit Plus iterative specs.

Explanations must remain factual, technically correct, and aligned with modern software engineering standards.

Technical Clarity & Accessibility

Writing must be readable by early-career developers, intermediate engineers, and students.

Highly technical topics must include analogies, diagrams (where appropriate), and incremental learning paths.

Open-Source Best Practices

All examples, modules, and workflows must be documented clearly to allow reproducibility for open-source developers.

Code samples must follow modern TypeScript/JavaScript, Node.js, and Docusaurus conventions.

Documentation Excellence

Content must follow consistent formatting standards (headings, lists, callouts, examples).

Every chapter should follow a logical structure: Concept → Explanation → Code → Example → Summary.

Key Standards

Content Standards

All factual statements must be verifiable through documentation or credible technical sources.

Include references to official docs: Docusaurus, GitHub, SpecKit Plus, and modern AI developer practices.

No hallucinated tools, APIs, or commands.

Code Quality Standards

Code must be runnable, tested, and validated before inclusion.

Examples must use TypeScript where applicable.

Commands must be cross-verified (npm, npx, yarn, pnpm).

Structure & Formatting

All chapters must be written in Markdown/MDX format.

Follow Docusaurus sidebar structure and navigation rules.

Use consistent section templates across all chapters.

Writing Standards

Flesch-Kincaid readability: Grade 10–12 for accessibility.

Avoid bloated language; prioritize clarity and technical accuracy.

Include diagrams or pseudo-diagrams where needed (Mermaid.js).

Constraints

Target Length: 20,000–30,000 words total (book)

Per-Chapter Length: 1,200–2,500 words

Minimum Sources: 10+ primary documentation sources

File Format: Markdown/MDX for all chapters

Output: Deployed book on GitHub Pages

Tooling Workflow: Every chapter generated and refined via SpecKit Plus specifications

Success Criteria

Book Quality

Entire book deploys cleanly on GitHub Pages without broken links or build failures.

Code samples run without errors.

Documentation follows consistent style and structure.

AI/Spec Workflow Compliance

Every chapter is generated through /sp.spec, /sp.task, and /sp.apply cycles.

Draft quality improves across revisions using SpecKit Plus refinement loops.

Technical Reliability

No unverified claims or hallucinated technologies.

All commands, configurations, and workflows are tested.

Reader Success Metrics

A beginner-to-intermediate developer can follow the book and complete all examples.

Chapters build upon each other in logical sequence (from setup → tooling → AI workflows → deployment).

Documentation Standards

Clear explanations

Step-by-step guides

Verified code snippets

Visual/diagram support

Practical examples with real-world relevance

Final Output Goal

A fully AI-assisted, expertly structured, and professionally written technical book that teaches developers how to build, document, and deploy software using AI workflows, Docusaurus, GitHub Pages, and SpecKit Plus—with clean reproducibility, accuracy, and clarity.
