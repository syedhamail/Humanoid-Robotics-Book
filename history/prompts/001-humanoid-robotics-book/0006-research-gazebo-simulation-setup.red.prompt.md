## Prompt

please retry

## Response snapshot

I have successfully researched and documented the core concepts for Gazebo simulation setup and physics integration for humanoid robots with ROS 2. Now I will document these findings in a new file: `research/gazebo_simulation_setup.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Documented Gazebo simulation setup and physics integration for humanoid robots with ROS 2.
- 🧪 Tests: No specific tests were run for this research task.
- 📁 Files: Created research/gazebo_simulation_setup.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with next research task related to NVIDIA Isaac Sim.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully performed web search and documented findings for Gazebo simulation as part of foundational research tasks.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
